Reading the 0 NegList
- For each analysis channel we should check which templates are negative
- They are added to lists (NegList.py) and forced positive -- Must be taken into account in Signal Model! 
- For Ewk HVV (2V) need templates : T1 -(4,0), T2 -(3,1), T3 -(2,2), T4 -(1,3), T5 -(0,4)
Get from SM-BSM mixture hypotheses : SM(1,0), M0(0,1), M1(1,.25), M2(1,.5), M3(1,.75) 
and G matrices Gai, Gl1, Gl1Zg
- Will create new file : rootFileJJH16Bset0/plots_JJH16Bset0_AC_MCStatsOFF.root with HVV analysis templates
 
- For ggF HVV (1V) need templates T1 -(2,0), T2 -(1,1), T3 -(0,2)
Get from SM-BSM MC : SM(1,0), BSM(0,1), M1(1,gMix) 
- Will create new file : rootFileJJH16Bset0/plots_JJH16Bset0_AC_MCStatsOFF.root with HVV analysis templates
 
- For ggH+2Jet HGG (1V) need templates T1 -(2,0), T2 -(1,1), T3 -(0,2)
Get from SM-BSM MC : SM(1,0), BSM(0,1), M1(1,gMix) 
- Will create new file : rootFileJJH16Bset0/plots_JJH16Bset0_AC_MCStatsOFF.root with HGG analysis templates

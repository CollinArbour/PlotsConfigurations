### Iter 0

- No morphing on the inputs


### Iter 1

- For loweta morphing gluon from j3 both pts extracted from W+jets 
- For higheta morphing quark from j0 both pts extracted from top

### Iter 2

- Apply gluon correction at high eta from j2 both pts
- Apply quark correction to low eta from j0 both pts
- keep also previous corrections

### Result

The gluon correction at high eta is only reducing the convegence on the quark side. 
So apply only quark correction at high eta and apply uncertainty on gluon at high eta (only high pt the line is different for each jet).
For loweta, applying gluon before and then quark get to convergence.
